# Doing?

I am comparing how the results from comparing different methods of galaxy growth result in different results

# Zfourge

This takes a number of deep observations, bins them by redshift and constructs the SMF for each redshift
This raw data is found in helpers.data.smf
This data can also be fit to a schechter function and is done by the Zfourge people
The single and double schechter params are in helpers.data.schechter

If you want to see this data, run growth_zfourge.py
That will give graphs of both the raw data and the fitted data
